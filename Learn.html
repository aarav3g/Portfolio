        <h2>Investments</h2>
        <h6> <em>What are Investments?</em>
            Investments are an important part of economics as a whole and your individual part in it. When done properly, they allow you to gain a source of some extra income that you can save over time. There are many different types of investments, including common stocks, mutual funds, bonds, etc. But as complicated as these might sound, they all approach the same idea: trying to use the money you already have to gain extra money in the future. This way, it functions a lot like the interest returns you get from putting money into the bank, only on a larger scale and with a little more risk involved.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before we talk about the types of investments, it is first important to understand how exactly they work. Investments are made when you  “wager” a certain amount of the money you have now in hopes that the future returns given to you will be greater than what you originally spent. This idea brings us to two important terms: return on investment and risk. The return on your investment is the money you can possibly gain for partaking in the investment, but the risk of the investment is the potential amount of money you can lose. You can compare making an investment to betting in poker: the more money you bet, the higher your potential returns, but also the greater the risk you are taking. 
            <br>
            Now that we understand the basic principles behind investment, let's talk about the different types of investments. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Common Stocks</em>
            Common stocks are the investments most people hear about and the ones that are commonly covered on news sources. They involve buying a stock in a company, which is to say, a very small percent of ownership of the company, in exchange for a monetary investment. You are essentially trusting the company to take your money and use it to make a profit. If the company makes a profit, they return a portion of the profit in proportion to the amount of money you originally invested. However, if the company you chose faces a loss, the money you invested won’t entirely be returned, so choose your investments wisely. There are, however, certain safeguards that make sure you won’t lose way too much money from each investment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When one of the stocks you own inevitably takes a dive, you have two choices available to you: selling or holding. You can sell your stock on the market to other investors – you will lose some money because you bought the stock for higher than it will go for sale on the market, but you will avoid losing more money in the future due to having that stock. The other option is to hold the stock and hope that it takes a turn for the better. This way, you can potentially gain money in the future, but you also run the continued risk of the stock selling for even less if its value continues to fall.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Mutual Funds</em>
            A mutual fund does virtually the same thing as investing in stocks, but instead of you choosing which stocks you invest in, the choices are made by a professional investor. The professional investor takes money from a lot of different clients and tries to invest it to get the most returns to give back to the clients later on. Since these investments are diversified, they do a good job at mitigating the risk each individual stock carries with it. Obviously, the professional team will take a small cut of the money you gain, but you will still gain a lot through this form of investment, especially because the professionals have more experience with the field.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Certificate of Deposit (CD)</em>
            A certificate of deposit is unique in that it doesn’t come with the same risks as the other forms of investment. These involve you depositing a lump sum of money into a bank or credit union for a long period of time – usually a few years. In exchange, you receive a high interest rate for your money that is fixed for the duration of the time period. Note that since the interest rate is fixed, you are guaranteed returns from this kind of investment. However, the downside here is that it takes a long time and withdrawing your money early can come with serious penalties, so a CD isn’t usually useful for the short term. However, these can be very good when trying to save money over time, say, for buying a house in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>U.S. Savings Bond</em>
            A US savings bond is essentially a loan you give to our government that will be paid back with interest at a maturity date (the end of the term of investment). Like CDs, these are extremely secure and are even endorsed by the federal government, so you likely won’t face any losses. However, this lack of risk means you also don’t earn as much as you would if you invested in the stock market. So, when do you know when to choose between CDs and bonds? Simple: Consider the interest rates being offered. When the bank interest rates are low, go with a bond, but when the banks are offering higher interest rates, go with the CDs.

        <h2>How to: Taxes</h2>
        <h6>Taxes. They’re an essential part of a government’s ability to help its people – you can’t make change without money. And because of that fact, everyone has to face them, everyone has to pay them, and they take a toll on everybody. But learning about the basics will help you be better equipped to manage them and prep your budget accordingly. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>What are Tax Returns?</em>
            Tax returns are forms in which citizens like you make annual statements that detail your income – in all its forms – and submit to the tax authorities so that they can assess your tax liability. They also allow you to schedule the payments of the taxes that you owe and request refunds if you accidentally overpay taxes. And they even allow you to claim deductions that will lower the income that the IRS considers taxable. “Allowable deductions might include payments you've made throughout the year to an IRA, the money you've paid in interest on student loans and any contributions you've made to a health savings plan.” Usually, tax returns are due by April 15th of any given year, unless that day falls on a holiday or weekend, in which case the date is adjusted slightly. These do exist in state and federal tax return forms. While filing these out might seem annoying, they are more than manageable if you understand how they work.

            <em>Income Taxes</em>
            Income taxes are a portion of your income that gets paid to the government through tax money. They are proportional to your income – that is to say, the higher your income, the higher the tax you’ll have to pay. Here’s a useful table:

        <h6>As you can see above, there are different tax “brackets” that people can fall into that depend on your income rate and marital status. Also, note that tax brackets are arranged from lowest to highest income, and the percent of that income that you pay to the government increases as one makes a higher level of income. A common misconception is that taxes only have to do with your salary – they have to do with all income, including interests and capital gains. There are, of course, certain deductions and tax credits that can affect which bracket you fall into. One more important thing about tax brackets: the percentages you see above aren’t necessarily fixed. These are actually the top marginal tax rates per bracket, meaning you may actually be made to pay less, but that the percentages shown are the maximum possible values you’ll have to deal with.

            <em>Federal and State Taxes</em>
            Federal taxes are the base taxes that are applied to all citizens and businesses, regardless of where you are in the country. On top of federal taxes lies your individual state’s tax. Specific information regarding your state can be found about this can be found easily through a quick google search.

            <em>Tips for Tax Filing</em>
            If you’re naturally good with numbers and keeping tabs on incomes, taxes, and expenses, you should fare well with most any online software that allows you to manage taxes. But there are also financial advisors available to you that specialize in taxes and can help do this for you if you wish for an extra hand. 
            You’ve fallen behind and you might not be able to file all your taxes in time. Don’t worry – Form 4868 is a way for you to get a maximum extension of 6 months that you can use to file your taxes. However, this doesn’t apply to payments, so you should continue to pay an estimate of what you owe so that you can avoid penalties and interest.

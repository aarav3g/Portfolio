        <h4>The Federal Reserve, or the Fed, is raising the interest rates on house loans in an effort to slow inflation. This means those trying to buy houses right now will have to pay back more money on top of their loan.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is a common tactic, meant to discourage people from spending large amounts of money on houses. The reasoning behind this is that if people stop spending large amounts of money, prices will decrease (because the demand has decreased), and the effects of inflation will slowly dissolve.
